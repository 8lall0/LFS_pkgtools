0.1
upgradepkg:
 - Removed /sbin when installpkg and removepkg are called (it calls installpkg and removepkg from the first dir of PATH, ergo /tools/bin)
 - Changed input of root dir (upgradepkg --root foo instead of ROOT=dir upgradepkg foo)
installpkg:
 - Removed warn, infobox, terse, menu, ask, priority, tagfile, md5sum options (i think we don't need this, i keep just the --root)
 - Adjusted output (i removed the slack-desc support)
 - Removed tar control (tar-1.13 or tar-1.blahblah, is it really important?)
removepkg:
 - Changed input of root dir (removepkg --root foo instead of ROOT=dir removepkg foo)
makepkg:
 - Added auto-fixing non-gzipped pages (to have a slackware-style gzipping man and info)
 - Removed description (same as installpkg)
 - Added strip option (auto-stripping binaries with --strip y or -s y)
