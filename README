Hi guys,
i have modified the pkgtool scripts to have t{g,z}x packaging support on LFS.
This is ONLY for the toolchain system (for now..)

Changelog:
11.15.2011
upgradepkg:
 - Removed /sbin when installpkg and removepkg are called (it calls installpkg and removepkg from the first dir of PATH, ergo /tools/bin)
 - Changed input of root dir (upgradepkg --root foo instead of ROOT=dir upgradepkg foo)
installpkg:
 - Removed warn, infobox, terse, menu, ask, priority, tagfile, md5sum options (i think we don't need this, i keep just the --root)
 - Adjusted output (i removed the slack-desc support)
 - Removed tar control (tar-1.13 or tar-1.blahblah, is it really important?)
removepkg:
 - Changed input of root dir (removepkg --root foo instead of ROOT=dir removepkg foo)
makepkg:
 - Added auto-fixing non-gzipped pages (to have a slackware-style gzipping man and info)
 - Removed description (same as installpkg)
 - Added strip option (auto-stripping binaries with --strip y or -s y)[/CODE]

I know that there are less flexible than original, but i think they are more useful than.

Usage (if you don't know it):

when you have to do "make install", just create a temporary dir (such as /tmp/foodir) and launch
$ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/foo

make the package with
$ cd /tmp/foo
$ makepkg -l y -c n -s y /root/foo-versionnumber-arch-build.txz (or tgz if you want to use gz compression, RECOMMENDED)

and install it
$installpkg --root $LFS /root/foo-versionnumber-arch-build.txz

I don't think that pkgtool and explodepkg are needed (we're just compiling, DAMN!)
Just copy the scripts in /tools/bin and launch a chmod +x on it.

PS: In a second time, i'm going to modify pkgtool for using into the LFS main system to make it more comfortable ;)

Every bug report and patch is well-accepted! :D
