Hi guys,
i have modified the pkgtool scripts to have t{g,z}x packaging support on LFS.
This is ONLY for the toolchain system (for now..)

NOTE: the script pkgtool is still unusable at now.

I know that there are less flexible than original, but i think they are more useful than.

Usage (if you don't know it):

when you have to do "make install", just create a temporary dir (such as /tmp/foodir) and launch
$ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/foo

make the package with
$ cd /tmp/foo
$ makepkg -l y -c n -s y /root/foo-versionnumber-arch-build.txz (or tgz if you want to use gz compression, RECOMMENDED)

and install it
$installpkg --root $LFS /root/foo-versionnumber-arch-build.txz

I don't think that pkgtool and explodepkg are needed (we're just compiling, DAMN!)
Just copy the scripts in /tools/bin and launch a chmod +x on it.

PS: In a second time, i'm going to modify pkgtool for using into the LFS main system to make it more comfortable ;)

Every bug report and patch is well-accepted! :D
