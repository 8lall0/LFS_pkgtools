This is a package that create the root tree of directories. It's a txz package, a Slackware-style package.
To install this you have to arrive at the end of the Chapter 5 of LFS book ( NOT BEFORE, NOT AFTER!! ) :

1) download all the scripts from git and put they on /tools/bin ( except of pkgtool ) and the .txz file.
2) make executable all of them ( chmod +x /tools/bin/{installpkg,removepkg,makepkg,upgradepkg,explodepkg} )
3) check if /tools/bin is at the beginning of your $PATH ( IMPORTANT!!! )
4) install the package with $LFS such as root ( installpkg --root=$LFS lfs_essentials-0.1-noarch-1.txz )

Now you can continue with the chapter 6, BUT jump the 6.5.1 since the "cat > /etc/group << EOF"
